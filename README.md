# Reactive state management with Angular

> This repo accompanies a tutorial written for Net magazine which explains how
> to use Redux with Angular and RxJS to manage your state reactively.

In this tutorial I'm going to show you how you can use the power of RxJS to
manage your application’s state with Redux.

In particular we'll look at how you can lazy-load portions of your store and
handle asynchronous actions with epics. To demonstrate this we’ll create an app
which hooks up with Wikipedia's API. You'll need a working knowledge of Redux
and its concepts.

## Requirements

 - Node 6.9.0 or higher
 - npm 3 or higher
